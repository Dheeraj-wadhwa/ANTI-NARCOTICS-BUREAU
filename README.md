I am telling you through this dashboard and explain the key insight clear and meaningful.

1. Overall Performance Snapshot

At the top of the dashboard, we see a high-level summary of anti-narcotics operations:

Total Cases: 500

Total Arrests: 2,279

Total Estimated Value Seized: ₹2,000 Crores

Total Quantity Seized: 49,874 Kg


2. Drug Seizures by State

The map visualization shows how drug seizures are distributed across Indian states.

States like Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and West Bengal stand out as major hotspots.

The map helps leadership quickly identify geographical risk zones that effect on the total estimated value and  total quantity seized.


3. Drugs Seized by Type (Quantity Perspective)

This bar chart compares drugs based on quantity seized:

Cocaine and Ganja are the most seized drugs by volume.

Chara's , Heroin, and Opium follow closely.

This indicates that while multiple drug types are present, ganja and cocaine dominate in volume, suggesting widespread distribution networks.


4. Drug Type Analysis by Value Share

Now, when we shift from quantity to value, the story changes slightly.

Cocaine and Heroin contribute a higher value share despite lower quantities.

This shows that high-value drugs pose a bigger economic threat, even if seized in smaller amounts.

This insight is critical for policy decisions and prioritizing high-impact operations.


5. Case Status vs Agency Performance

This chart compares case outcomes between agencies:

Both ANB and Joint Task Forces show a balanced number of open and closed cases.

A healthy closure rate indicates efficient investigation and prosecution.


6. Time Series Trend – Operational Growth

Finally, the time series trend shows monthly patterns:

Drug seizures peak in the early months, followed by a slight dip mid-year.

Toward the end of the year, we again see an upward trend, possibly due to increased enforcement drives or festive-season trafficking.

This helps planners anticipate future spikes and prepare resources in advance.

7. Filters for Decision-Making

The filters on the left—Drug Type, Quantity, Agency, Case Status, and State—allow users to:
