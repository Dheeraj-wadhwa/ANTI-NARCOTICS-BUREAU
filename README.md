Anti-Narcotics Bureau Dashboard – Analytical Report
1. Executive Summary

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of anti-narcotics operations across multiple states. It analyzes drug seizures, arrests, operational effectiveness, case status, and trends over time. The report supports data-driven decision-making for law enforcement agencies by identifying high-risk regions, high-impact drug types, and effective operational strategies.

2. Key Performance Overview

Total Cases: 500

Total Quantity Seized: 49,874 Kg

Total Estimated Value: ₹2,000 Crore

Total Arrests: 2,279

👉 These KPIs indicate a high operational impact with significant seizures and strong enforcement activity.

3. Regional Analysis (Drug Seizures by State)

The geographic map highlights state-wise distribution of seized drugs.

Certain states emerge as high-risk hotspots with significantly larger seizure volumes.

These regions require continued monitoring and higher resource allocation.

Insight: Drug trafficking activity is geographically concentrated rather than evenly distributed.

4. Drug Type Analysis
a) Drugs Seized by Quantity

Cocaine and Ganja account for the highest seized quantities.

Other drugs such as Heroin, Charas, MDMA, and Opium show moderate to lower volumes.

Insight: Enforcement efforts are encountering higher volumes of plant-based and synthetic drugs.

b) Drug Type by Value Share

High-value drugs contribute disproportionately to total value despite lower quantities.

Cocaine and Heroin dominate the economic impact.

Insight: Value-based prioritization is critical, not just quantity-based enforcement.

5. Arrest Analysis (Drug Type vs Arrests)

Certain drug types result in significantly higher arrest counts.

This indicates stronger criminal networks and targeted enforcement in those drug categories.

Insight: Drug types with higher arrest rates demand sustained intelligence-based operations.

6. Operational Effectiveness

Operations were analyzed across:

Raids

Intelligence-based operations

Checkpoints

Findings:

Raids and intelligence-based operations show the highest seizure value and success.

Checkpoints are comparatively less effective.

Insight: Intelligence-driven enforcement yields the highest operational returns.

7. Case Status & Agency Performance

Comparison between ANB and Joint Task Force reveals differences in case closure efficiency.

ANB demonstrates stronger performance in closing cases.

Insight: Agency-level best practices can be replicated to improve overall efficiency.

8. Case Aging & Funnel Analysis

A noticeable portion of cases remain open for extended periods.

Funnel analysis shows drop-offs from registration → arrest → closure.

Insight: Legal and procedural bottlenecks affect case closure timelines.

9. Time Series Trend Analysis

Monthly trends reveal fluctuations in seizures and value.

Certain periods show spikes, indicating seasonal or operation-driven patterns.

Insight: Trend analysis supports forecasting and proactive operational planning.

10. Dashboard Interactivity

Filters enable analysis by:

Drug Type

State

Agency

Case Status

Operation Type

This allows stakeholders to conduct focused, scenario-based analysis.

11. Business & Strategic Value

Identifies high-risk regions and drug categories

Evaluates effectiveness of enforcement strategies

Highlights process inefficiencies

Supports evidence-based policy and operational decisions

12. Conclusion

The Anti-Narcotics Bureau dashboard delivers a data-driven view of enforcement performance, combining operational, geographic, and temporal insights. By integrating advanced visuals and consistent color coding, the dashboard enhances clarity, usability, and strategic value for executive and operational stakeholders.
